This is a [core module](http://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#gapcursor) of [ProseMirror](http://prosemirror.net).
ProseMirror is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and custom
document schemas.

This [plugin](http://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#gapcursor) implements a
block-level cursor that can be used to focus places that don't allow
regular selection (such as positions that have a leaf block node,
table, or the end of the document both before and after them). Make
sure you load `style/gapcursor.css` (or define your own styling for
the cursor).

The [project page](http://prosemirror.net) has more information, a
number of [examples](http://prosemirror.net/examples/) and the
[documentation](http://prosemirror.net/docs/).

This code is released under an
[MIT license](https://github.com/prosemirror/prosemirror/tree/master/LICENSE).
There's a [forum](http://discuss.prosemirror.net) for general
discussion and support requests, and the
[Github bug tracker](https://github.com/prosemirror/prosemirror/issues)
is the place to report issues.

We aim to be an inclusive, welcoming community. To make that explicit,
we have a [code of
conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/) that applies
to communication around the project.
